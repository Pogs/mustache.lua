=== mustache.lua ===


= What?
    - Mustache is a logic free template language
    - Based on github.com/defunkt/mustache

= Why?
    - To learn Lua (I'm new to it, let me know if something is not Lua-esque)
    - Also, didn't see github.com/nrk/hige

= Status
    - Right now only individual tags work
        - Normal tags: {{ foo }} or {{foo}}
        - Unescaping: {{ &foo }} or {{{foo}}}
        - Comments: {{! This won't appear }}
    - Run 'lua tests.lua' to see some examples that work
    - Sections are a work in progress
