=== mustache.lua ===


= What?
    - Mustache is a logic free template language
    - Based on github.com/defunkt/mustache

= Why?
    - To learn Lua (I'm new to it, let me know if something is not Lua-esque)
    - Also, didn't see github.com/nrk/hige

= Status
    - Mostly complete
    - Working:
        - Normal tags
        - Unescaped tags
        - Comment tags
        - Inverted sections
        - Wrappers
        - Dictionaries
        - Lists of key/value pairs
        - Empty lists
        - Booleans
    - Run 'lua tests.lua' to see examples that work

= Todo
    - Rendering to and from files
    - Iteration as in mustache.js, with {{ . }}
    - Test fully on examples is Defunkt's Mustache docs
